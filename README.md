# 04-2D-Platformer


## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.3.3

  Newly Stylized TileMap for base level
  Much of my time was spent trying to fix the bug from the Hide and Seek exercise.
    I solved it in a way that is likely not great for code architecture but it's fixed.
  Added Background music from Juicy Match-3 game
